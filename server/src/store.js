 * One tasks file per project, the union in one object.
 *
 * The store stays a **single** object with a **single** emitter — see the
 * contract in `keys.js`, «The store stays one object, and one event emitter»:
 * `index.js` wires the websocket to one emitter and `upgrade.js` to the same
 * one, so an instance per project would leave the browser hearing about the
 * first project only, silently. Being backed by one file per project is an
 * internal detail of this module.
 *
 * In memory, tasks are indexed by the canonical key `<project>#<issue>`. On
 * disk, each project's file keeps the shape it has always had — `{ "<issue>":
 * task }` — so today's `tasks.json` is adopted as is, with no migration and no
 * rewrite. The only addition is `project` on every task, stamped at load time
 * because `keyOf` refuses a task without one.
