/**
 * ## The store stays one object, and one event emitter
 *
 * The obvious shape — a `Store` instance per project — is wrong here, and the
 * reason is not in `store.js`: `index.js` subscribes the websocket to **one**
 * emitter, and `upgrade.js` subscribes to the same one. Split the store into
 * an instance per project and each gets its own emitter, so the browser would
 * only ever hear about the first project's tasks, silently.
 *
 * So `store` remains a single object with a single emitter. Being backed by
 * one file per project is an internal detail of `store.js`, not a shape its
 * callers see. That is also what keeps the fifty-odd call sites working while
 * they are converted, one package at a time.
 *
 * - `store.all()` returns the **union** across projects, ordered by `issue`
 *   descending with `project` breaking ties. This is what keeps the
 *   account-wide things correct without touching them: the active-task count
 *   against the global `maxActiveTasks`, the snapshot the board renders, and
 *   the "is the board idle" sweep the upgrade waits on.
 * - `store.get(v)` accepts a bare issue number, a numeric string, or a
 *   canonical key — see {@link coerceKey}. Anything else answers `undefined`.
 * - `store.addTask(issue, projectId)` requires `projectId`: omitting it throws
 *   `falta el proyecto en addTask`.
 * - `store.flush()` writes every dirty project's file.
 *
 * ### Events keep their positional shape and gain `project` last
 *
 * `'log'`, `'chat'` and `'chat-update'` keep every argument they have today
 * and take `project` as one more at the end. Existing listeners ignore an
 * extra argument, so nothing has to change in step; the web package reads it
 * when it is ready. Renaming or reordering would mean editing every listener
 * in the same commit as `store.js`, which is exactly the flag-day this design
 * exists to avoid.

 *   { type: 'chat', project, issue, chatId, text, attachments }
 *                   ^^^^^^^ new
 *
 * `project` and `issue` stay separate on the wire, same as in URLs; the server
 * composes the key with `makeKey(msg.project, msg.issue)`. The handler today
 * does `sendChat(Number(msg.issue), …)` and ignores any project.
 *
 * OUTGOING (board → browser), at index.js:760-763:
 *
 *   { type: 'task', task }              task.project rides INSIDE the task — no
 *                                       new top-level field. `publicTask()` must
 *                                       carry `project` through.
 *   { type: 'log', project, issue, entry }          index.js:761 — gains `project`
 *   { type: 'chat', project, issue, chatId, message } index.js:762 — gains `project`
 *   { type: 'chat-update', project, issue, chatId, ...update } index.js:763 — gains `project`

 * The store's `log`/`chat`/`chat-update` events therefore have to emit the
 * project alongside the issue; a listener that only sees an issue cannot route
 * the message to the right card.
 *
 * SNAPSHOT (index.js:781, sent once per connection; the same object `GET
 * /api/tasks` returns). The UI package depends on this more than on anything
 * else, so, precisely — it keeps every field it has today (`tasks`, `active`,
 * `settings`, `github`, `models`, `poll`, `defaultChatModel`, `project`,
 * `machines`, `upgrade`, `quota`, `usage`) and gains two:

 *   {

 *     activeProject: string,     // the id the board OPENS on -- the first of
 *                                // projects[]. Not server-held selection:
 *                                // switching project in one browser must not
 *                                // switch it in another, and this board is

 * How the project reaches the modules that do not take a task
 *
 * Everything above travels inside a task. These five do not, and each one was
 * found in review as a signature two packages would otherwise have had to
 * invent separately and incompatibly. In all five the project is required:
 * omitting it throws `falta el proyecto en <fn>`, never a fall back to
 * {@link DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID}.
 *
 * 1. GITHUB (`github.js`). `repo()` caches one value for the life of the
 *    process; it becomes `repo(projectId)` over a `Map`. Every exported
 *    function takes `projectId` as a TRAILING argument -- `getIssue(n,
 *    projectId)`, `prView(n, projectId)` -- except the three that already take
 *    an options object, where it rides inside it: `prsForBranch(branch,
 *    {cache, project})`, `checksForOpenPrs({force, project})`,
 *    `createDraftPr({branch, title, body, project})`. The assignee and the
 *    reviewer stop coming from `config.github` and come from the registry
 *    entry. `prBranchCache` keys on `${repo}:${branch}`: a branch name alone
 *    would collide across repositories, which is this whole exercise in
 *    miniature.
 *
 * 2. BRANCHES (`worktree.js`). `listAllBranches({force, project})` and
 *    `findBranchesForIssue(issue, {project})`, with the cache keyed per
 *    project. Today both reach for the local machine's checkout, which is
 *    hfs's; a second project's branches are not in it.
 *
 * 3. MACHINES (`machine.js`). `machineFor(name, projectId)` is the primitive.
 *    For the default project it returns `machines()[name]` EXACTLY as today --
 *    live `config.project`, not the registry, because the registry freezes its
 *    seed on first load while `config` reloads, and several tests mutate
 *    `config.project` and expect the machine to follow. For another project on
 *    `local` it returns a view over the same machine with that project's
 *    `repoPath`/`worktreeRoot`; on a runner it throws, since no second project
 *    is declared there. `machineOf(task) = machineFor(task.machine ?? 'local',
 *    task.project)`.
 *
 * 4. PROMPTS (`prompts.js`). `renderPrompt(name, vars)` reads two new optional
 *    vars and still returns a string: `vars.projectId` picks the descriptor and
 *    the invariants, and `vars.onInvariantInjected({id, phrase, source})` fires
 *    once per load-bearing phrase the board had to put back. The callback is
 *    the only way the backstop can reach a task's log, since `renderPrompt` has
 *    no task. Extra keys in `vars` are ignored by the validator, which checks
 *    the template's placeholders, not the caller's object.
 *
 * 5. IMPORTING (`POST /api/projects`). Takes `{repoPath}` and as little else as
 *    possible, because the repository already knows most of it: the remote
 *    gives `repo` (`repo-identity.js`), the convention gives `worktreeRoot`
 *    (`<checkout>-wt`), the last path segment gives `id`. Returns 201 with the
 *    `Project`, or 400 carrying the registry's own refusal message -- a
 *    forbidden override, a bad id, a path that is not there.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------ */
