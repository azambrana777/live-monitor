/**
 * Who drives a task: the board or you.
 *
 * This used to be told twice — a `manual` boolean and a `'manual'` flow state —
 * and every bug came from the two disagreeing. Marking a task manual *started*
 * it (worktree and a full triage) before parking; the switch was read once, so
 * flipping it mid-flight changed nothing; and the state was terminal, with the
 * switch as the only way out of it.
 *
 * Now there is one field and one rule: **the board only starts work on a task
 * whose mode is `auto`**. The mode says nothing about what you can do by hand —
 * the chat, the worktree button and the servers work in every mode.
 *
 * Kept free of every other module of the board on purpose: these are the
 * decisions worth testing, and `pipeline.js` drags in the whole machine.
 *
 * One exception, and it is worth stating: `usage-limit.js`, whose only content
 * is the SDK's list of usage-limit prefixes and a check against it. The
 * migration below has to recognise a limit notice that was saved as demo
 * steps, and copying those strings here is exactly how a new prefix would be
 * missed. So this file does load the SDK — indirectly, through a module that
 * imports nothing else. What it still does not load is any state of the board.
